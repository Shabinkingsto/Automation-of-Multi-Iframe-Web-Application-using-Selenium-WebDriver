# Automation-of-Multi-Iframe-Web-Application-using-Selenium-WebDriver

Project Summary: Automation of Multi-Iframe Web Application using Selenium WebDriver
This project focuses on automating a web application that contains multiple nested iframes using Selenium WebDriver with Java. The automation script navigates through the application's user interface, switches control between different iframes, and interacts with web elements such as input fields and buttons. It demonstrates proficiency in iframe handling, dynamic element identification using XPath and CSS selectors, and the simulation of end-user actions like data entry and form submission.

The main goal of the project was to validate the functional behavior of a login form embedded within an iframe, ensuring accurate data input and smooth form submission. The script also includes basic synchronization using Thread.sleep(), with scope for enhancement via explicit waits and integration with testing frameworks like TestNG or JUnit.

This project showcases practical knowledge of real-time automation challenges such as:

Navigating iframe hierarchies

Locating deeply nested elements

Managing dynamic web content

It serves as a foundational piece in building robust automated UI test suites for iframe-heavy applications.
